          What is Lake Time you ask? Lake Time is not a time, but a state of
          mind â€” or an absence of time. Eat when you are hungry. Sleep when you
          are tired. Fish, swim, read a great book, and enjoy the sunshine when
          you please. Naps are encouraged. Friends and family are welcome.
          Nature is embraced. That is Lake Time.
